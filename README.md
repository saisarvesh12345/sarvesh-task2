In this task, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to gain an initial understanding of the structure and characteristics of the data. We started by loading the dataset and checking its dimensions, data types, and missing values. Using visual tools like histograms and boxplots, we explored the distribution and presence of outliers in numerical features such as Age and Fare. We also generated a heatmap and pairplot to study correlations and relationships between variables like passenger class, age, and survival. Additionally, we examined categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Pclass) to observe their effect on survival rates. Through this process, we identified key features, detected data issues, and prepared valuable insights for future modeling steps.
